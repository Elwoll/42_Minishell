<h1>Minishell</h1>

<h2>Objectives</h2>
<p>The objective of this project is to realize a simple version of a shell based on bash.<br>
  By using readline, processes and system signal (sygaction, ...) we have to replicate a shell.<br>
  Being the first group project of the common core, it's also a good training to have a good work pipeline with other people.<br>
  <h2>Result</h2>

  <h2>To do</h2>
  <p>Change the _ environnment variable after each command<br>
  Might want to redo a bit the exit built-in<br>
  Check and fix the built-in when use with a redirection<br>
  Might wanna check the correct execution when using a redirection multiple times<br>
  Need to normed and retype the redirection function<br>
  Add alloc_check function that call exit function<br>
  </p>
