<h2>Objectives</h2>
<p>The objective of this project is to realize a simple version of a shell based on bash.<br>
  By using readline, processes and system signal (sygaction, ...) we have to replicate a shell.<br>
  Being the first group project of the common core, it's also a good training to have a good work pipeline with other people.<br>
