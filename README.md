<h1>Minishell</h1>

<h2>Objectives</h2>
<p>The objective of this project is to realize a simple version of a shell based on bash.<br>
  By using readline, processes and system signal (sygaction, ...) we have to replicate a shell.<br>
  Being the first group project of the common core, it's also a good training to have a good work pipeline with other people.<br>
  <h2>Result</h2>

  <h2>To do</h2>
  <p>
  Check and fix the built-in when use with a redirection<br>
  Check if tab_format_env correctly reset when using export and unset built-ins<br>
  Completely fill exit_free function to avoid leaks<br>
  Check if environment variable is NULL to do nothing<br>
  Correctly stop the main programm when simple or double quote is not closed<br>
  </p>
